                <p>Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and champions of agricultural innovation, we are
                    thrilled to present to you the 3rd Edition of the OFAB Media Awards (OMA) 2024, an event

                </p>
                <p>As you know, journalism plays a pivotal role in shaping public understanding and driving conversations on key issues like food security, sustainable farming, and the technological
                    advancements critical to Rwanda's agricultural development. These awards recognize credible
                    and ethical journalism that fosters constructive dialogue, promotes science-based reporting,
                    and ultimately supports Rwanda's mission to build a thriving, tech-driven agricultural sector.
                </p>
                <p>This invitation-only event brings together Rwandan media professionals, business leaders,
                    government officials, and civil society stakeholders. Together, we celebrate the exceptional
                    contributions of journalists who have reported insightful, accurate, and impactful stories on
                    the application of modern biotechnology in agriculture.</p>
